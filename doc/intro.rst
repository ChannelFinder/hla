Introduction
=============

This manual describes ``aphla`` the Accelerator Physics High Level
Applications for storage ring commissioning and beam studies. Particularly we
will use it for the `NSLS-II <http://www.bnl.gov/nsls2>`_ project.

``aphla`` is a package of both libraries and Graphical User Interface (GUI)
applications.  Besides the commonly used applications, like Beam based
alignment, the HLA includes a set of APIs (Application Programming Interface)
which is used for writing further scripts and interactive controls.
