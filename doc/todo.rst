TODO 
---------

.. role:: done

- IRMIS/Database support for Tracy simulator and results.

    - Lattice
    - Simulated results

- DONE(GS): :done:`Virtual accelerator on a separated server`
- DONE(LY): :done:`Fill Python interface, make some of them working even
  without lower level support. (done)`
- Python/Tracy interface (Choi):

   this part is quite important for LOCO type of lattice fitting and is
   not depending on other parts of HLA. We can see some progress in near
   future.
- Channel Finder (Guobao): Will be ready soon.

   I have programmed a local replica of this service, but it's very good
   to have a service version soon, since GUI applications from CSS can use
   it.

- Integrated testing when subsystem is done.
- DONE(LY): :done:`GUI: orbit`
- GUI: beam based alignment
- CAVITY: cell ? girder ? symmetry ? --L.Y.
- Split Sextupoles ? two PV now in Virtual ACC --L.Y.
- Never ending: Keep working on design doc, reflect the real code.
- :done:`Misalignment of magnets in VIOC/Tracy` (Guobao)
- Local version of VIOC/Tracy (Guobao)
- :done:`Tracy lattice parser` (Choi, Lingyun)
- Twiss Server (Guobao, Guimei, Lingyun, Don): we all have discussed it a
  lot. Will have it after channel finder.
- :done:`Orbit control/analysis, ORM, local bump`, physics routines (Lingyun).
- Discuss with diagnostics, BPM, RF, Insertion Device, ...
- Come up a list of applications with details, including algorithm, GUI,
  and discuss with Sam/Bob for more comments. Then present in AP group
  meeting for more feedbacks.
- Continuous integration, unit test, build, distribution, documentation
